<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In recent years, buzzwords like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have permeated every industry, and cyber security is no exception. In the media there is a lot of discussion around AI and ML but what is the difference between these two and how can organizations leverage AI for cybersecurity?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will delve into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and its close relative, machine learning (ML), while exploring its indispensable role in identifying and mitigating threats within the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Lesson Objectives</h4>
<p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the difference between AI and ML</li>
<li>Identify reasons why organizations are using AI for threat detection</li>
</ul>

<h3>AI versus ML</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related terms but represent different concepts. Letâ€™s start with an overview of AI and ML.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making, through the use of algorithms and data processing.</p>
<p>It encompasses a wide range of techniques, algorithms, and approaches to enable machines to perceive, reason, learn, and make decisions. AI encompasses both narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to replicate human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks.</p>
<p>Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, is a specific subset of AI. It is a computational approach that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</p>
<p>Machine learning algorithms are designed to analyze and interpret data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that analysis. In essence, ML algorithms learn from data rather than relying on explicit instructions from a computer programmer. ML is a key component of many AI systems and enables them to automatically adapt and improve over time.</p>

<h3>The AI/ML Advantage in Threat Detection&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Within the realm of cybersecurity, AI and ML play a crucial role in threat detection. Cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated and complex, necessitating advanced techniques to identify and respond to them effectively. By harnessing the power of AI and ML, security systems can autonomously analyze vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and adapt to emerging threats in real time.</p>
<p>Threat detection in cybersecurity involves the continuous monitoring and identification of malicious activities or anomalies that could potentially compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of computer systems or networks. It encompasses various aspects, including the identification of malware, intrusion attempts, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p>
<p>AI and ML are pivotal in enhancing threat detection capabilities. Through their ability to learn from historical data and patterns, machine learning algorithms can identify subtle indicators of potential threats, even in highly complex and dynamic environments. These algorithms can autonomously analyze network traffic, user behavior, and system logs to detect anomalous patterns that may indicate malicious activities or breaches.</p>
<p>AI-driven threat detection systems can evolve and improve over time as they learn from new data and adapt to emerging threats. This adaptability enables the system to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals, continually refining its detection mechanisms and effectively countering the ever-changing threat landscape.</p>

<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">Consider the following scenario from the world of basketball:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If a programmer wrote an application that had a player dribbling a basketball, they could write the code for the player to dribble the ball similar to Lebron James.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">However, if the programmer then wanted the player to be able to dribble the ball like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant, they would have to manually reprogram the application with the new ways of dribbling the ball.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">With machine learning, the application could be fed data about each playerâ€™s dribbling technique and then adapt the application to each technique automatically.</p>
</details>
<p>So what are the main reasons why organizations are choosing AI and ML in their cybersecurity solutions?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is gaining in popularity and may become a key tool in the fight against traditional opportunistic cybercriminals as well as well-funded <strong>advanced persistent threat (APT)</strong> groups.</li>
<li>AI-powered threat detection solutions may help organizations identify and respond to cybersecurity threats more effectively and efficiently in real time. AI threat detection works by analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns of suspicious and/or malicious activity. It can be leveraged to identify emerging threats that have no prior known pattern. This data is typically collected from threat intelligence feeds and past incidents. The data can include things like network traffic, email messaging, abnormal application behavior, abnormal end-user behavior, and other <strong>indicators of compromise (IOC)</strong>.</li>
<li>AI algorithms can then learn from this data and identify new threats as they emerge against an organization. This can help organizations reduce their <strong>mean time to discovery (MTTD)</strong> of a breach and it helps organizations become more proactive in their defense.</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence is a way to enhance and augment traditional methods for detecting and combating cybersecurity threats.</li>
